## HW9

Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(WeightIt)
library(cobalt)
library(broom)
library(marginaleffects)
library(modelsummary)

library(gssr)
gss2022 <- gss_get_yr(2022)
```

### 9.1.1

Choose one outcome variable and one “treatment” variable

Let's do **POLVIEWS** as treatment, and **LETIN1A** as outcome.

*(also interesting: NOTSMART, AFRAIDOF, INCOM16, MADEG)*

```{r}
gss2022$polviews[0]
gss2022$letin1a[0]
```

Naive estimate for effect of $T$ (family's income at 16 years old) on $Y$ (attitude about immigration reduction / increase):

```{r}
naive_data <- gss2022 |> select(letin1a, polviews) |> haven::zap_labels()
naive_m <- lm(letin1a ~ polviews, data = naive_data)
tidy(naive_m)
```

Naively, looks like an increase of one point away from extremely liberal (1), towards extremely conservative (7) drives a .331 point movement away from immigration should be increased a lot (1) toward immigration should be reduced a lot (5).

Let's look at the factor version of polviews, so we can see what the increase at each step is:

```{r}
naive_m <- lm(letin1a ~ factor(polviews), data = naive_data)
tidy(naive_m)
```

Wait. I smell... POLARIZATION

```{r}
ests <- c(0, 0.2404295, 0.6587506, 1.0397810, 1.2947305, 1.6838993, 1.7643468)

# Plotting vertical lines at each estimate value
ggplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ests, color = "blue") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

Hmm. Kind of.

### 9.1.2

Think of possible confounding variables that might affect this estimate.

Draw a DAG

![](images/clipboard-3162582392.png)

What is your estimand (ATE, ATT, ATU)?

> ATE. We infer that all people are at least a little "treated" by their given political attitudes, and that this has some generalized "treatment effect" on attitudes towards immigration.

### 9.1.3

Select the appropriate covariates in the GSS that allow for causal identification.\
Make a note of any transformations.

-   Parents' education
    -   PADEG, MADEG
-   Parents / grandparents born in US
    -   Binarized, 0 if one of the parents was not: PABORN/ MABORN
    -   Binarized, 0 if one of the grandparents was not: GRANBORN
-   Grew up in urban, suburban, or rural area
    -   RES16
-   Grew up in diverse / immigrant community
    -   Instead, using current racial composition of neighborhood: RACLIVE
-   Grew up in high / mid / low income family
    -   INCOM16
-   Respondent's race
    -   Binarized, 1 if nonwhite: RACE
-   Respondent's age
    -   AGE
-   Respondent's political leaning
    -   POLVIEWS
-   Respondent's education level
    -   EDUC
-   Respondent experienced unemployment
    -   UNEMP
-   Respondent's religion
    -   RELIG
-   Respondent born in the US
    -   Binarized, 0 if not born in the US: BORN

Are there any variables missing from the DAG you drew earlier?

> I couldn't find a proxy for:
>
> -   parents' political leaning
>
> -   Clean variable for parents experiencing unemployment. Decided to use respondent unemployment instead, as also seems relavent
>
> -   R's media consumption / the portrayal of immigrants therein
>
> -   Whether area R grew up in was diverse / immigrant community, so using self-reported diversity of current community because it also seems relavent

```{r}
d_r <- gss2022 |> 
  select(
    letin1a, polviews,
    padeg, madeg, paborn, maborn,
    granborn, res16, raclive, race,
    ethnic, age, incom16, educ,
    unemp, relig, born
  ) |> drop_na() |> 
  mutate(
    nonwhite = if_else(race == 1, 0L, 1L),
    parents_born_us = if_else(paborn == 1 & maborn == 1, 1L, 0L),
    grands_born_us = if_else(granborn == 0, 1L, 0L),
    born_us = if_else(born == 1, 1L, 0L),
    less_immigrants = if_else(letin1a > 3, 1L, 0L) # binarized version, unused
  )
```

### 9.1.4

Using regression to get the effect of `incom16` on `letin1a`.

```{r}
form <- as.formula("letin1a ~ factor(polviews) + factor(padeg) + factor(madeg) +                        unemp + grands_born_us + factor(res16) + raclive + nonwhite + 
                   age + I(age^2) + factor(incom16) + educ + I(educ^2) + 
                   factor(relig) + born_us + parents_born_us")

form_cont_polviews <- as.formula("letin1a ~ polviews + factor(padeg) + factor(madeg) + unemp + grands_born_us + factor(res16) + raclive + nonwhite + age + I(age^2) + factor(incom16) + educ + I(educ^2) + factor(relig) + born_us + parents_born_us")

m_lm <- lm(form, data = d_r)
m_lm_cont_polviews <- lm(form_cont_polviews, data = d_r)
```

Checking out model, ATE:

```{r}
tidy(m_lm_cont_polviews, cof.int = TRUE) |> filter(term == "polviews")
tidy(m_lm, conf.int = TRUE)
avg_slopes(m_lm, variables = "polviews")
```

Interesting - just gonna take a peek at how the POLARIZATIOn seems now.

```{r}
ests_r <- c(0.01, 0.301, 0.804, 1.131, 1.228, 1.625, 1.867)

# Plotting vertical lines at each estimate value
ggplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ests, color = "blue") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ests_r, color = "orange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Interesting.

### 9.1.5

Try to achieve covariate balancing.

**CBPS**

```{r}
trt_form <- as.formula("factor(polviews) ~ factor(padeg) + factor(madeg) +                                    unemp + grands_born_us + factor(res16) + raclive + nonwhite + 
                        age + I(age^2) + factor(incom16) + educ + I(educ^2) + 
                        factor(relig) + born_us + parents_born_us")

cbps_weights <- weightit(trt_form, data = d_r, method = "cbps", 
                         estimand = "ate", over = FALSE)
summary(cbps_weights)
love.plot(cbps_weights,
          thresholds = .1, stats = c("m","ks"))
```

```{r}
cbps_est_naive <- lm(letin1a ~ polviews, data = d_r, 
                     weights = cbps_weights$weights)

cbps_est_naive_factor <- lm(letin1a ~ factor(polviews), data = d_r, 
                            weights = cbps_weights$weights)

tidy(cbps_est_naive, conf.int = TRUE)
tidy(cbps_est_naive_factor, conf.int = TRUE)
```

Crudely comparing to factor estimates from naive estimate again:

```{r}
ests_w <- c(0.01, 0.0471939, 0.4757196, 0.8537163, 0.9625970, 1.3347595, 1.4498106)

# Plotting vertical lines at each estimate value
ggplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ests, color = "blue") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = ests_w, color = "magenta") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### 9.1.6

Combining weighting and regression, what is the effect of T on Y*?*

```{r}
m_robust <- lm(form, data = d_r, 
               weights = cbps_weights$weights)

m_robust_cont_polviews <- lm(form_cont_polviews, data = d_r, 
                             weights = cbps_weights$weights)

tidy(m_robust_cont_polviews, conf.int = TRUE) |> filter(term == "polviews")
avg_slopes(m_robust, 
           variables = "polviews", 
           wts = cbps_weights$weights)
```

### **9.1.7 - Findings**

*"Write 3-5 paragraphs explaining your research question, the methods you used, and the answer you came up with."*

In this homework, I set out to find the impact of political leaning on immigration attitudes. To do this, I used data from the 2022 GSS, and adjusted for the impacts of potential confounding variables using weighting and regression. My hypothesis at the outset was that more conservative political attitudes would be associated with less enthusiasm towards immigration, and this was measurably true here.

The most apt treatment variable available was POLVIEWS, which allows respondents to self-report political inclination on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is extremely liberal, 4 is moderate, and 7 is extremely conservative. The outcome variable that fit best was LETIN1A, a 1 to 5 scale which captures respondents' opinion on how the amount of immigration to the U.S. should change, where 1 is increase a lot, 3 is remain the same, and 5 is reduce a lot. A naive estimate given by a linear regression found that generally, every increase of 1 point in POLVIEWS (read, toward conservatism) resulted in a .331 point increase in LETIN1A (read, toward a immigration reduction stance).

I created a DAG to represent the potential confounding variables. I hoped to capture information about the respondents' upbringing and current circumstances that would potentially impact their political leaning and / or their attitudes about immigration. This included variables related to family immigration history, childhood living circumstances, diversity of living area, education and income levels, race and ethnicity, and age (to capture generational cohort effects). The full list of variables selected to capture these factors is above.

Weights generated by the CBPS method in the WeightIt package allowed us to reduce the bias introduced by selection effects, and combination with a regression model over the selected confounders led to a more robust estimate of the relationship between POLVIEWS and LETIN1A. With weighting and correction, we find a .253 increase in LETIN1A for every 1 point increase in POLVIEWS, when POLVIEWS is viewed as continuous. However, allowing our analysis to be ordinal by using the factor version of POLVIEWS, we can see the more granular relative increase in LETIN1A for each value of POLVIEWS (see last output above). Across all analyses, and after correction for potential bias, the hypothesized positive relationship between conservatism and less enthusiasm towards immigration to the U.S. held.
